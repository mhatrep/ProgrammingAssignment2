# Matrix inversion is CPU intensive calculation. Caching offers performance 
# boost for the inverse operation. makeCacheMatrix performs the steps below.
# 1) set value of matrix
# 2) get value of matrix
# 3) set value of inverse of  matrix
# 4) get value of inverse of  matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {








}


## Compute inverse of matrix.
# If inverse is already calculated, retrieve from cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
